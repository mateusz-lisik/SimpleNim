Simple Nim
==========

Project inspired video called *[The Unbeatable Game from the 60s: Dr NIM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KABcmczPdg)* by Matt Parker from StandupMaths. 

## Goals
I made this project because I've never made any kind of game, so I guess this is the moment to code something every junior dev is capable of. 
In addition to that - doing some neat OOP designs is always a plus. 
Also I always wanted to make desktop app in JavaFX but never had a chance, lets change it! 

Btw. I couldn't resist taking new, shiny JUnit5 for a spin.

## Modules

### Core
Game logic, AI, and stuff

### Terminal
CLI client of the game

### GUI
JavaFX version of the game client

### Rest
Oh Jesus, why? You made Spring Rest application for that?
